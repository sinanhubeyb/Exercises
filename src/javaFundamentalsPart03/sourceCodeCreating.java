    3 phases for creating a java program
    1- Creating source code
    2-Compiling source code to bytecode
    3-Execute the codes by JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

    After creating a new project (in any name) right click 'src' package and choose 'New-> Package'. Give a name for your
    new Package. Then right-click your new package and choose 'New->Class(Java Class)' and give a name for your class
    And in your class which is like this:


    package packageName;

    public class className{
    public static void main(String[] args){
    //If you don't see this 'main method' you can write yourself or write main and click ctrl+space and IDE will help
    System.out.println("Hello World");


     }
    }

    This is your first code. If you want to see your code in the terminal you must execute the code. In short way you cn click
    'run' button or for ex in IntelliJ IDEA in the menu choose Build->Make Project or Build->Compile 'className.java'

    You will see in your terminal ===> Hello World
