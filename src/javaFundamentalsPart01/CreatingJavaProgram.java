    To create a java program, it is necessary to use the .java plugin at the end of the created files.
    ex: MyProgram.java

    instead of translating this source code into binary code for a specific processor and operating system,
    it is compiled into the binary code of a virtual machine with a virtual processor and operating system

    This is called the byte code. It is saved in a file with extension 'class' -> ex: MyProgram.class
